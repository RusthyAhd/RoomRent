# RoomRent App Optimization Summary

## Changes Made to Make Your App Professional

### 1. **Consolidated Launch Pages**
- **Removed**: `launch_page_simple.dart` (redundant simple version)

- **Result**: Single, optimized launch page with smooth animations

### 2. **Removed Unnecessary Files**
- **Deleted**: `home_screen_new.dart` (empty file)
